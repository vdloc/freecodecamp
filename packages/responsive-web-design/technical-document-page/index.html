                <p> Loops, loops, loops. As well as being associated with popular breakfast cereals, roller coasters
                    and
                    musical production, they are also a critical concept in programming. Programming loops are all to
                    do
                    with doing the same thing over and over again — which is termed iteration in programming speak.</p>

                <p> Let's consider the case of a farmer that is making sure he has enough food to feed his family for
                    the
                    week. He might use the following loop to achieve this:</p>

                <p>A loop usually has one or more of the following features:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>A counter, which is initialized with a certain value — this is the starting point of the loop
                        ("Start:
                        I have no food", above).</li>
                    <li>An exit condition, which is the criteria under which the loop stops — usually the counter
                        reaching a
                        certain value. This is illustrated by "Have I got enough food?", above. Let's say he needs 10
                        portions
                        of food to feed his family.</li>
                    <li>
                        An iterator, which generally increments the counter by a small amount on each successive loop,
                        until it
                        reaches the exit condition. We haven't explicitly illustrated this above, but we could think
                        about the
                        farmer being able to collect say 2 portions of food per hour. After each hour, the amount of
                        food he
                        has collected is incremented by two, and he checks whether he has enough food. If he has
                        reached 10
                        portions (the exit condition), he can stop collecting and go home.</li>
                </ul>

                <p> In pseudocode, this would look something like the following:</p>

                <pre>
                    <code>
    loop(food = 0; foodNeeded = 10) {
    if (food = foodNeeded) {
    exit loop;
    // We have enough food; let's go home
    } else {
    food += 2; // Spend an hour collecting 2 more food
    // loop will then run again
    }
    }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>So the amount of food needed is set at 10, and the amount the farmer currently has is set at 0. In
                    each iteration of the loop we check whether the amount of food the farmer has is equal to the
                    amount he needs. If so, we can exit the loop. If not, the farmer spends an hour collecting two
                    portions of food, and the loop runs again.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Let's start exploring some specific loop constructs. The first, which you'll use most of the time,
                    is the for loop — this has the following syntax:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    for (initializer; exit-condition; final-expression) {
    // code to run
    }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>Here we have:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The keyword for, followed by some parentheses.</li>
                    <li>Inside the parentheses we have three items, separated by semi-colons:
                        <ol>
                            <li>An initializer — this is usually a variable set to a number, which is incremented to
                                count the number of times the loop has run. It is also sometimes referred to as a
                                counter variable.</li>
                            <li>An exit-condition — as mentioned before, this defines when the loop should stop
                                looping. This is generally an expression featuring a comparison operator, a test to see
                                if the exit condition has been met.</li>
                            <li>A final-expression — this is always evaluated (or run) each time the loop has gone
                                through a full iteration. It usually serves to increment (or in some cases decrement)
                                the counter variable, to bring it closer to the exit condition value.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Some curly braces that contain a block of code — this code will be run each time the loop
                        iterates.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Let's look at a real example so we can visualize what these do more clearly.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    var cats = ['Bill', 'Jeff', 'Pete', 'Biggles', 'Jasmin'];
    var info = 'My cats are called ';
    var para = document.querySelector('p');

    for (var i = 0; i < cats.length; i++) {
        info += cats[i] + ', ';
    }

    para.textContent = info;
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>
                    This gives us the following output:
                </p>
                <pre>My cats are called Bill, Jeff, Pete, Biggles, Jasmin, </pre>

                <h3 class="section-title">
                    Exiting loops with break

            </header>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>If you want to exit a loop before all the iterations have been completed, you can use the break
                    statement. We already met this in the previous article when we looked at switch statements — when a
                    case is met in a switch statement that matches the input expression, the break statement
                    immediately exits the switch statement and moves onto the code after it.</p>

                <p>It's the same with loops — a break statement will immediately exit the loop and make the browser
                    move on to any code that follows it.</p>

                <p>Say we wanted to search through an array of contacts and telephone numbers and return just the
                    number we wanted to find? First, some simple HTML — a text input allowing us to
                    enter a name to
                    search for, a button element to submit a search, and a element to display the results in:</p>

                <p>Now on to the JavaScript:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    var contacts = ['Chris:2232322', 'Sarah:3453456', 'Bill:7654322', 'Mary:9998769', 'Dianne:9384975'];
    var para = document.querySelector('p');
    var input = document.querySelector('input');
    var btn = document.querySelector('button');

    btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
    var searchName = input.value;
    input.value = '';
    input.focus();
    for (var i = 0; i < contacts.length; i++) {
        var splitContact = contacts[i].split(':');
        if (splitContact[0] === searchName) {
        para.textContent = splitContact[0] + '\'s number is ' + splitContact[1] + '.';
        break;
        } else {
        para.textContent = 'Contact not found.';
        }
    }
    });
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Skipping_iterations_with_continue">

            </header>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The continue statement works in a similar manner to break, but instead of breaking out of the loop
                    entirely, it skips to the next iteration of the loop. Let's look at another example that takes a
                    number as an input, and returns only the numbers that are squares of integers (whole numbers).</p>

                <p>The HTML is basically the same as the last example — a simple text input, and a paragraph for
                    output. The JavaScript is mostly the same too, although the loop itself is a bit different:</p>

                <pre>
                        <code>
    var num = input.value;

    for (var i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    var sqRoot = Math.sqrt(i);
    if (Math.floor(sqRoot) !== sqRoot) {
        continue;
    }

    para.textContent += i + ' ';
    }
                        </code>
                    </pre>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="while_and_do_..._while">

                <h3 class="section-title">
                    while and do ... while

            </header>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>for is not the only type of loop available in JavaScript. There are actually many others and, while
                    you don't need to understand all of these now, it is worth having a look at the structure of a
                    couple of others so that you can recognize the same features at work in a slightly different way.</p>
                <p>First, let's have a look at the while loop. This loop's syntax looks like so:</p>
                <pre>
                   <code>
    initializer
    while (exit-condition) {
        // code to run
    
        final-expression
    }
                   </code>
               </pre>
                <p>This works in a very similar way to the for loop, except that the initializer variable is set before
                    the loop, and the final-expression is included inside the loop after the code to run — rather than
                    these two items being included inside the parentheses. The exit-condition is included inside the
                    parentheses, which are preceded by the while keyword rather than for.</p>
                <p>The same three items are still present, and they are still defined in the same order as they are in
                    the for loop — this makes sense, as you still have to have an initializer defined before you can
                    check whether it has reached the exit-condition; the final-condition is then run after the code
                    inside the loop has run (an iteration has been completed), which will only happen if the
                    exit-condition has still not been reached.</p>
                <p>Let's have a look again at our cats list example, but rewritten to use a while loop:</p>
                <pre>
                   <code>
    var i = 0;

    while (i < cats.length) {
        if (i === cats.length - 1) {
        info += 'and ' + cats[i] + '.';
        } else {
        info += cats[i] + ', ';
        }

        i++;
    }
                   </code>
               </pre>
            </div>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Which_loop_type_should_you_use?">

                <h3 class="section-title">
                    Which loop type should you use?
                </h3>
            </header>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>For basic uses, for, while, and do...while loops are largely interchangeable. They can all be used
                    to solve the same problems, and which one you use will largely depend on your personal preference —
                    which one you find easiest to remember or most intuitive. Let's have a look at them again.</p>
                <p>First for:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    for (initializer; exit-condition; final-expression) {
    // code to run
    }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>while:</p>
                <pre>
                <code>
    initializer
    while (exit-condition) {
    // code to run

    final-expression
    }
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>and finally do...while:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    initializer
    do {
    // code to run

    final-expression
    } while (exit-condition)
                    </code>
                </pre>
                <p>We would recommend for, at least to begin with, as it is probably the easiest for remembering
                    everything — the initializer, exit-condition, and final-expression all have to go neatly into the
                    parentheses, so it is easy to see where they are and check that you aren't missing them.</p>
